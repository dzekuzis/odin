  <ol>
    <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Cook and stir together mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Lay down half of the lasagna noodles and layer half each ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
